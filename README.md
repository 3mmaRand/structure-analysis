The rendered document can be found [here](https://3mmarand.github.io/structure-analysis/anti_mimetics_workshop_3.html).


You can download the Project by doing one of:

-   using the green Code button above | Download ZIP. Then unzip,  open the Project in RStudio and open "anti_mimetics_workshop_3.qmd"

-   running `usethis::use_course(url = "3mmaRand/structure-analysis")` in RStudio. This will download the Project and open it in RStudio. The open "anti_mimetics_workshop_3.qmd"
